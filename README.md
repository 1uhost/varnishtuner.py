# varnishtuner.py
Varnish Cache Tuner

This python script checks Varnish stats and server settings hoping to recommend optimal values for Varnish Cache parameters. Script is currently an alpha release and is plagued with bugs and issues. It's also written to work with a subset of Varnish deployments (namely those we target with our cPanel Varnish and cPanel Varnish Nginx plugins - see http://www.unixy.net/varnish/ ). Patches are welcome!
